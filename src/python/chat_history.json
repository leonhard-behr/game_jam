I think the lights might be broken or maybe they're just really dim. I've lost count of the days myself.\n\nI have to say, it's a bit disorienting at first, but you'll get used to it. Just take your time and try to adjust. There's not much else we can do in here, anyway.\n\nWhat about you? How long have you been here? And what did they put you in for?"

I don't know the details, but I've heard rumors that this place is run by a mysterious organization with questionable motives.\n\nAs for you, where am I? Well, that's the million-dollar question. I've been trying to find any clues or hints that might give us an idea of our location, but so far, nothing concrete has turned up.\n\nYou might want to take a closer look around your cell. Are there any markings on the walls? Any unusual symbols or patterns? And have you found anything that might be used as a tool or leverage?\n\nBy the way, I've been exploring my own cell and found some interesting things. There's a small crack in one of the bars that might be useful later on. Just saying."

There's something about the complexities and strategies involved in that world that really resonated with me.\n\nBut enough about books. You mentioned finding things in your cell? What did you find exactly? Anything useful or noteworthy?\n\nBy the way, have you noticed any changes in the darkness? Sometimes I think it gets a little brighter for short periods, but then it goes back to being pitch black again. Weird, right?"
